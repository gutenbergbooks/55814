    [Illustration]

      Old Mother Hubbard
      Went to the Cupboard,
    To give the poor Dog a bone.
      When she came there,
      The Cupboard was bare,
    And so the poor Dog had none.

    [Illustration]

    She went to the Baker's
      To buy him some bread;
    When she came back
      The Dog was dead!

    [Illustration]

    She went to the Undertaker's
      To buy him a Coffin;
    When she came back
      The Dog was laughing.

    [Illustration]

    She took a clean dish
      To get him some tripe;
    When she came back
      He was smoking his pipe.

    [Illustration]

    She went to the Alehouse
      To get him some beer;
    When she came back
      The Dog sat in a Chair.

    [Illustration]

    She went to the Tavern
      For white wine and red;
    When she came back
      The Dog stood on his head.

    [Illustration]

    She went to the Fruiterer's
      To buy him some fruit;
    When she came back
      He was playing the flute.

    [Illustration]

    She went to the Taylor's
      To buy him a coat;
    When she came back
      He was riding a goat.

    [Illustration]

    She went to the Hatter's
      To buy him a hat;
    When she came back
      He was feeding her Cat.

    She went to the Barber's
      To buy him a wig;
    When she came back
      He was dancing a jig.

    [Illustration]

    She went to the Cobbler's
      To buy him some shoes;
    When she came back
      He was reading the news.

    [Illustration]

    She went to the Sempstress
      To buy him some linen;
    When she came back
      The Dog was spinning.

    [Illustration]

    She went to the Hosier's
      To buy him some hose;
    When she came back
      He was drest in his clothes.

    [Illustration]

    The Dame made a courtesy,
      The Dog made a bow;
    The Dame said, Your servant,
      The Dog said, Bow-wow.

    [Illustration]

    This wonderful Dog
      Was Dame Hubbard's delight,
    He could Read, he could Dance,
      He could Sing, he could Write;
    She gave him rich dainties
      Whenever he fed,
    And erected this Monument
      When he was dead.
